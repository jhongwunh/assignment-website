# What is Shinylive?

**Shinylive** is a new way to run Shiny applications entirely in the user's web browser — without needing an R server or any backend infrastructure.

It uses WebAssembly to run R inside the browser. This makes it possible to create fully interactive Shiny apps that can be published as static websites, similar to Quarto.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How Is It Different from Shiny?

| Feature | Shiny (Traditional) | Shinylive |
|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Requires R Server | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Deployable on GitHub Pages / Quarto Pub | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Real-time interactivity | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (in browser) |
| Best for | Dynamic dashboards for internal use | Teaching, prototyping, simple demos |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Pros and Cons

### ✅ Pros of Shinylive

-   No need to host a server
-   Easy to share via GitHub Pages or Quarto Pub
-   Fully interactive
-   Free and fast to deploy
-   Great for teaching or demonstrations

### ⚠️ Cons of Shinylive

-   Slower performance than server-backed apps
-   Not suitable for large datasets or intensive computation
-   Limited support for some Shiny features

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Why It’s Useful

Shinylive is a great tool to:

-   Allow anyone to explore data **interactively** in a browser
-   Share demo apps for teaching and tutorials
-   Publish interactive visualizations with **minimal setup**

This makes it an excellent option for students, researchers, educators, and developers who want to deliver interactive R experiences without worrying about backend deployment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Code Deployment

To create a Shinylive app, you can use:

``` bash
quarto add quarto-ext/shinylive
```

Then place your `.qmd` file under a `shiny:` format and publish it like any other Quarto website.

Due to current technical constraints, this Shiny application cannot be rendered interactively in this static preview. However, the full Shinylive version can be deployed with `quarto preview` using an appropriate CLI setup.
